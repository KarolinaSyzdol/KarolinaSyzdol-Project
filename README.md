Work is something you achieve, not somewhere you go
My professional experience has been related to marketing and business support so far. Now I am on my way to changing my professional life. I've started to get knowledge, and experience to become a software tester.
I have chosen this career path because for me testing is about learning, exploring, analyzing, verifying, and evaluating. And that is exactly what I would like to develop into.
My passion for long-life learning as well as being detail-oriented and responsible can help me in this process. Thanks to my business experience I’m commercially aware and can communicate confidently with both technical and non-technical teams at all organizational levels. Also, my strong analytical skills and conceptual thinking, enable me to understand complex business situations, see the “big picture” and come up with solutions.
I have just finished a testing course, however, it is extremely essential for me not to stop developing. The most important is the possibility to learn through practice. That's why I have decided to start mentoring to gain new skills by practicing.
